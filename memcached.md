# Memcached
Memcached (https://memcached.org/) is an open-source database. 
Memcached utilizes an in-memory key-value store data model. 
It can use the client/server or cloud hosting model. 
Java can access Memcached by using the telnet command on the HOST and PORT names. 
Then, to connect Memcached and a Java application, we add the Memcached jar into our classpath
